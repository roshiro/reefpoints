We need to start this part with a bug fix. There is a bug for the live reload. In `ember/tests/helpers/start-app.js`
insert the 2nd line:

```js
var Router = require('bostonember/router')['default'];
```

Now on line 16 add:

```js
Router.reopen({
  location: 'none'
});
```

This bug exists in `0.0.27` of ember-cli and will hopefully be fixed in a future verision.

([there is a pending PR to fix this](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues/667))

Now start your server:

```bash
cd ember
ember server
```

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:4200/tests`

You should see something like the following:

This is a typical [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test suite with some
[JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) tests already in our app. What you'll notice in the lower
right-hand corner is a blank white box. This box is where our
integration tests will execute. This is an IFRAME so we can see our
applications interacted with in real-time (albeit very fast real-time).

Let's build out a landing page for our app. We will TDD this entire
application over this multi-part series. Create a new directory and file
`ember/tests/integration/landing-page-test.js`.

All of our files will be in
[ES6 module](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules)
format. If you are unfamiliar with ES6 modules I suggest you go and read
up.

```js
import startApp from '../helpers/start-app';

var App;

module('Integration - Landing Page', {
  setup: function() {
    App = startApp();
  },
  teardown: function() {
    Ember.run(App, 'destroy');
  }
});

test('Should welcome me to Boston Ember', function() {
  visit('/').then(function() {
    equal(find('h2#title').text(), 'Welcome to Boston Ember');
  });
});
```

Once you save this file go back to your browser. You should not need to reload anything, ember-cli has a live reload feature on file
change. Now you should see your failing test:

![Screen2](http://i.imgur.com/l7y146I.png)

Let's make the test pass:

In `ember/app/templates/application.hbs`

```hbs
<h2 id="title">Welcome to Boston Ember</h2>
{{outlet}}
```

Check your test suite and it should be all green.

Congratulations on your first ember test!

Next time we'll build out some pages and write tests to interact with
these pages.
